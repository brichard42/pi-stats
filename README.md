# PI-STATS

My very first [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/).
It's a very simple website to monitor a rasberry-pi server.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000/stats](http://localhost:3000/stats) with your browser to see the result.
