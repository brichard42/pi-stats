# PI-STATS

My very first [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/).

Just wanted to try it out (and read some documentation for fun ðŸ¤“). It's a very simple website to monitor a headless rasberry-pi server. You have to reload the page to get updated infos.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000/stats](http://localhost:3000/stats) with your browser to see the result.
